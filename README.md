A simple Dataviz project to discover Node.js runtime environment with Express, PostgreSQL, Chart.js, ejs-npm, pg-npm and nodemon-npm.


### Project :
* Responsive charts of geopolitical thematics in Libya over several decades
* Interactive svg map of middle-east


### What i have learn :

#### Node.js 
* Server-side application runtime environment
* SSR by templating plain javascript with ejs
* Server/Client non-blocking events logic
* Modular architecture thinking and syntax
* Understanding how code behave in different runtime environments and dealing with this diverse execution conditions to make design 
  decisions
* Full steps involved in understanding and using libraries
  
#### Express
* Routing - how the server should respond when a request matching a method (HTTP) and a path (URL) is received
* When and how to use static/dynamic and server/client rendering

#### PostgreSQL
* Finding, evaluating and using datasets (cleaning, formating, preprocessing)
* Modeling database connexion
* SQL query

#### Deferred technical aspects :
* Middleware routing
* Route parameters
* User authentification and authorization features
* Using Sequelize for ORM
* Table relationships (one-one, one-many, many-many) and the advanced sql query associated with them
* Cleaner and more precise handling of navigation with both server-side and client-side routing
